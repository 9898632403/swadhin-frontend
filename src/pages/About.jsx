      <p className="max-w-3xl text-lg leading-relaxed">
        <strong>SWADHIN</strong> is more than just a clothing platform — it is a story of self-belief, artistic expression, and meaningful connections.
        Founded as a dream by a passionate woman, SWADHIN stands for <em>"Swa" (self) + "Adhin" (independent)</em>, symbolizing the spirit of building something on one’s own terms.
        <br /><br />
        We are committed to offering not only stylish and contemporary fashion, but also the highest level of comfort and personalized service. From inspired design concepts to handcrafted detailing, every piece reflects our dedication to wearable art.
        <br /><br />
        SWADHIN is also a growing movement to bring together and uplift women handworkers by giving them meaningful work, preserving traditional techniques while embracing modern aesthetics.
        <br /><br />
        Our collections are designed for everyone — men, women, and youth — celebrating individuality, diversity, and bold creativity.
        <br /><br />
        With a vision to become a trusted and loved brand, SWADHIN is building a future where fashion connects, empowers, and inspires — one story, one stitch at a time.
